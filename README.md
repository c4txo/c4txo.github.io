# Cat's Portfolio Website

A modern, dynamic portfolio website built with Next.js featuring an intelligent slideshow factory system for showcasing photography and event galleries. Fully supports agentic development.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Slideshow Factory**: Automatically generates photo galleries from asset directory structure
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast, SEO-friendly pages with Next.js
- **Automatic Asset Management**: Seamless copying of assets to public directory
- **File-Based Content**: No database required - content managed through file structure

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.4, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with static export
- **Asset Management**: Automated copying system
- **Routing**: Dynamic page generation based on portfolio categories

## Project Structure

```
portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # React components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SlideshowFactory.js  # Main slideshow system
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Slideshow.js         # Individual slideshow component
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CategoryPage.js      # Reusable page template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/               # Next.js pages and routing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/               # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                  # Source images (organized by category/event)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                  # Static assets (auto-generated)
â””â”€â”€ agents_dev.md           # Comprehensive development guide
```

## How It Works

1. **Content Organization**: Photos are organized in `assets/[Category]/[Event Name_MM-DD-YYYY]/`
2. **Automatic Processing**: The system scans the asset directory and generates metadata
3. **Dynamic Pages**: Each category gets its own page with multiple event slideshows
4. **Sorting**: Events are sorted by date (newest first) with intelligent parsing
